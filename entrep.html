			<p>In TrashLine, I worked with a team of three other individuals to create an artificially
				intelligent machine to sort waste between trash and recycling. This machine has three steps: 
				place, classify, sort. We built a conveyer belt that
				carries the waste placed by the user towards a camera, which then takes a snapshot. With TensorFlow based object recognition, 
				a Raspberry Pi classifies the waste as either recycling or trash. Though we had a rather primitive prototype, our team tried to demonstrate that 
				with intelligent object recognition, we can help eliminate the large rates of misrecycling in the United States
				to help reduce landfill pollution and fight global warming. I played a major role in designing and building the physical prototype out of 
				wood and VEX Robotics parts. We went through multiple iterations of the physical design, and eventually settled on a conveyer belt with an arm that 
				sweeps the waste to the left or right. More details of our research, designs, and implementation can be found in our project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iA3jAF-bEi-jLSLONKP2MtpScav7CuXOAI4lr6GnGAU/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>.

			<p>In SmartSpecs, I worked with a team of three other individuals to create a pair of smart glasses which has
				an electronic and interactive screen project on the glasses. The goal of the project was to create an affordable
				smart glasses that you can use to augment reality and use other applications. SmartSpecs was designed in CAD as a 3D
				printable add on to conventional glasses and featured an OLED screen that was reflected onto an external polycarbonate lens in front
				of the glasses. Though the SmartSpecs was interactionless and could only display text, it had the capability to use a camera
				to detect objects. I worked mainly on helping design the various prototypes of the smart glasses add on, starting with cardboard to
				figure out the general dimensions and shifting over to more durable 3D printed plastic. I also was tasked to figure out how to effectively
				reflect and magnify the OLED display onto the SmartSpecs lense. More details of our research, designs, and implementation can be found in our project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUd3M6CpLlPt8Pq6QG4E5VaT5eKV88EGDxJpSmuKdu8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

			<p>In CoronaGuard, I worked with a team of three other individuals to create a smart and secure contact tracing mobile application to track the spread of 
				COVID-19 and recommend people to self-quarantine based on calculated risk values. CoronaGuard works by emitting and receiving unique user identifier tags
				via Bluetooth to anonymously track interactions and notify users if they have been in direct, indirect, or distant contacts with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19.
				CoronaGuard also features an NFC scanning system which can be licensed to small business and public spaces to check their customers and potentially bar high risk individuals from entering their property.  
				I worked mainly in developing the frontend user interface using Flutter, which is a cross-platform software development kit for making apps in Android and iOS. I also played a key 
				role in programming the notification system and helped integrate the front end with the Firebase cloud database and backend contact network models. More details of our research, 
				designs, and implementation can be found in our project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2FNCgqn0oZSqYwyk95CV_thrXyTbwRRwcvPk_jX5CA/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>.
