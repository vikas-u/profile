			<h1>Guest Speakers</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:100px;">
		<h3 align="center">Laura Kegelmeyer</h3>
		<p>
			There have been many guest speakers that come to Dublin High to talk about their engineering disciplines and their 
			contributions to the field. One of the speakers that was influential to me was Laura Kegelmeyer.  
			A researcher at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory for the National Ignition Facility, Kegelmeyer was working on developing a 
			machine learning algorithm to detect defects in doped mirrors. The National Ignition Facility uses hundreds of doped mirrors 
			to amplify a laser by a factor of 10 billion and it is especially important to monitor they system to check for defects and impurities. 
			It was very interesting to see how the advent of Artificial 
			Intelligence and Machine Learning are expanding into industries such as scientific research. Kegelmeyer essential automated the 
			traditionally human work of inspecting things with your eyes by using a computer's vision and advanced recognition techniques. 
			Her talk inspired me of the power 
			of computer science and versatile applications in the world’s most powerful laser ignition facility.
			
						<br>
		</p>
		
		<h3 align="center">Maher Salloum</h3>
		<p>
			Another speaker that stood out to me was Maher Salloum. A researcher in the Sandia National Laboratory, he discussed his work in 
			developing a compression algorithm for scientific data. It was really impressive how Salloum was able to
			 preserve the main essence of data after compressing it close to one hundred times, though losing some data
			  from lossy compression. Both Kegelmeyer and Salloum gave me a new perspective on computer science, specifically 
			  data science. Typically, people think of computer science as sedentary, monotone desk job in which a person programs
			   on computer screen for eight hours a day. However, these new practices of data science and machine learning have very 
			   elegant and powerful use cases for practically every industry on the planet, and as technology continues to advance and 
			   progress, we will continue to see its power in our day to day life.

			<h1>Field Trips</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:100px;">


		<h3 align="center">NASA Ames Research Center</h3>
		<p>
			My first field trip I attended was at the NASA Ames Research Center. Among many other things, Ames is known for its massive wind 
			tunnels, which are used to test and improve the construction of large-scale vehicles based on wind generated by large fans.
			 I was intrigued by the sheer scale of the wind tunnels as we toured through the mission control facilities and eventually 
			 got the chance to stand in the middle of the gigantic area. We had the opportunity to stand in front of six 22,500 
			 horsepower motors used to test aircrafts. I also got to visualize how air flows through aircrafts by using fluid chambers. 
			 The picture above demonstrates how fluids move around a space shuttle, which is important for aerodynamic analysis. Seeing 
			 the science behind how fluids, whether it be air or liquid, moves through objects made me more cognizant of how fluids move
			  through everyday objects. 
			<br>
		</p>

		<h3 align="center">Patriot Jet Team Foundation</h3>
		<p>
			 On my trip to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation,
			 I learned much about fundamental principles of aerodynamics, history of war aircrafts, emerging flight technologies, and the sheer scale of the 
			 universe. Ed Daley, a very knowledgeable pilot, led our tour and explained the components of various aircrafts on display in the hanger. It was 
			 especially incredible how Daley took us on adventure of the different parts of the aircraft through the point of view of an engineer, with his 
			 explanations on the thought processes of how specific parts were designed. I was amazed of the many intricacies of aerodynamic design, since 
			 every single component is vital to successful flight performance in consideration of proper weight distribution, center of gravity, compactness, 
			 and more. Daley also talked about emerging technologies in the aeronautics field, including Virgin Galactic and SpaceX’s reusable rockets. These 
			 technologies are very exciting because all are steps closer towards space travel towards Mars.
			<br>
		</p>
		
		<h3 align="center">National Ignition Facility</h3>
		<p>
			Another field trip that was influential to me at Lawrence Livermore National Labratories (LLNL). There, we toured the National Ignition Facility (NIF) with 
			knowledgeable LLNL staff and got to see the vast magnititude of their lasers. NIF is the largest and most energyic laser facility in the world which allows them 
			to conduct interesting research with nuclear fusion, the same process which happens in the sun! The facility is huge and three football fields can fit inside 
			of it. From the LLNL staff, I learned a lot about their unique process of amplifying lasers from just a billionth of a joule to increasing its energy by a factor of 
			about 10 billion. Just standing there, it was amazing how much distance the lasers had to travel and how a team of humans were able to create such a sophistocated and
			 precisely engineered marvel. Their mission control area allows them to intricately monitor the laser system closely to determine any sources of error and they also routinely use 
			 cameras and machine learning to detect impurities in their glass amplifiers. 

			<br>
		</p>

		<h3 align="center">Livermore Aviation Tour</h3>
		<p>
			I always used to pass the Livermore Municipal Airport when I was young, and virtually touring the facility 
			really opened my eyes to the complex hierarchies and operations inside. The airport provides customer 
			services to maximize returns and the Livermore location is a headquarter for California operations. The 
			views from the test flight overseeing the valley were absolutely incredible, as if the plane were like an 
			American bald eagle soaring through the evening sky. I also got a glimpse into the procedural checklists 
			and preflight actions that were required before taking flight. The New Frontier Aerospace talk featuring 
			their organ-transferring drone was also an interesting presentation and it got me thinking about the 
			limitless possibilities of using aviation to solve real world problems. 

			<br>
		</p>

		<h3 align="center">Roche Career Day</h3>
		<p>
			During the Roche two-day virtual presentation, I learned a lot about the research and development of Roche’s 
			COVID-19 tests. On the first day, we got to virtually tour their facilities and learned about the rigorous 
			sanitary and safety procedures required. For example, Roche’s rigid standards require its medical workers 
			to wear fully-protective HazMat suits which ensures that external contamination is an afterthought. On the 
			second day, we learned about the basics of IVD product development. This pipeline includes research, early 
			development, feasibility, verification, and validation. Through many iterations of this cycle, the product 
			is finally launched when fully approved and validated. It was interesting to see how these IVD product 
			development methodologies overlapped with the iterative design process we were exposed to in engineering 
			classes. It made me appreciate the amount of work and thought put into medical products, as they require an 
			immense amount of labor and time to mature from a simple idea into a full-fledged product that could affect 
			someone’s life. 


			<br>
		</p>

		<h3 align="center">Lawrence Livermore National Lab Job Shadow</h3>
		<p>
			During the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) Job Shadow, I had the opportunity to learn about various jobs of 
			research scientists and engineers in different fields of study. First, I learned about the career of a 
			bioinformatics researcher, who was using genomic data to create predictive models. By analyzing how their models
			run and testing different model architectures, the bioinformatics scientists were able to discover new attributes
			about COVID-19 and other diseases. Next, I virtually toured the massive supercomputer at LLNL through the perspective
			of a systems programmer. It was truly amazing to graps the sheer scale of the computer, which boasted thousands of CPUs
			and GPUs. There was much thought that went into the layout and airflow of the building as well to effectively cool such a 
			large computer, which was constantly running many calculations and simulations. Experiencing this LLNL Job Shadow has got 
			me excited about high performance computing and using predictive models to solve real world problems like discovering
			genomic correlations about COVID-19.

	</div>
	<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:100px;">
		<p>Through the Engineering Academy, I had the pleasure of having Rupert Young as my mentor. He is an experienced and extremely knowledgeable individual in the fields of 
			cybersecurity, data science, computer systems, and management. Graduating from MIT with a degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Rupert has had an extensive 
			career working as a director or product manager at Bellcore Labs, AT&T, Feeva, Quova, Neustar, FutureNow, and Cog System. Every month, I learned a lot from Rupert about career choices, life 
			skills, resume building, interview preparation, college life, and college admission strategies. He taught me some strategies when preparing for interviews, such as asking 
			clarifying questions to buy time, helped me polish my resume by making me realize how to format it from a recruiter's perspective. This summer, Rupert gave me the opportunity 
			to be a summer intern at Cog Systems, where I got to work with virtualization and the Android architecture for Cog's Virtualized Mobile Device. He has been an amazing mentor to me 
			and I hope to be in contact with him in the future.
