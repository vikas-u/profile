			<p>In the Scratch project, my partner, Jonathan Wang, and I were assigned to
				create a user-interactive game or story using Scratch code, a documentation
				process , and commented code. Through several sessions of brainstorming, my
				team eventually decided on creating a car-game in which players can jump over
				obstacles and progress through more difficult levels called <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173528386/">Xtreme Riderz</a>. I
				played a key role in the programming aspect as well as the documentation
				aspect for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KW_FhDH7srDtN41J_vpfHooBYmn0aiQZzPqYT7mTacg/edit?usp=sharing">Project Notebook</a>. We discovered the drag and drop features
				and the basic variables types that are found throughout every programming
				language. Throughout the project, Jonathan and I explored the simplicity
				and user-friendly interface of Scratch, however we also realized the
				weaknesses of Scratch as it had a high latency and the time-consuming
				drag-and-drop feature. Effective communication and teamwork allowed my
				team to complete aspects of the project in an efficient manner.

			<p>The objective of the Python Image Manipulation Project was to create a user interactive photo editing software to demonstrate
				detailed algorithmic photo manipulation, similar to a Photoshop workflow. To meet our
				clients needs, my team, Ritviksiddha Penchala and I, created the Pixel Pro Photo Editor, a
				versatile image manipulator which would include features such as double exposure, text integration,
				pixelation art, tints, and saturation manipulation. Despite the limitations of the Cloud9 Non-GUI Environment, we
				expanded our knowledge of Python by utilizing a multitude of libraries, including OpenCV, which
				helped us accomplish our objectives. The cronological progress and explanations of image manipulation algorithms
				was outlined in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eL9WUSAhvnT6aBdmZz-qa8gNTVzRvB9EA-Dc5Tc61qg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Additionally, we
				applied our knowledge of Python class structures in this project, which
				helped us establish a great understanding of the true advantages of object oriented programming.

			<p>In the Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project, a car using solar panels and hydrogen cells was designed, with the
				main goal of making a recommendation to the client on which configuration of electrical wiring and power
				sources would be the most efficient. With the collaboration of my team, I constructed the main chassis of
				the vehicle as well as the mountings for motors, power sources, and the breadboard. Throughout the iterative
				design process, we consciously made decisions in order to optimize the vehicle for speed. As opposed to
				using VEX steel parts, we prioritized working with plastic and aluminum components, to make the overall
				mass of the vehicle less. Since the vehicle was required to drive for exactly one meter, it was decided
				to sacrifice structural stability for reducing weight. After testing various configurations with series
				and parallel circuits and combinations of solar and hydrogen power sources, we recommended using two solar
				panels in series, to achieve higher voltage and greater efficiency. The results of testing and in depth
				analysis of our recommendation can be found in our team online

			<p>The objective of the West Point Bridge Design Project was to design a bridge that was cost efficient, specifically less than $300,000,
				and also had adequate stability. Initially, research was conducted on the various types of trusses used for industrial purposes. With my
				partner Gaurav Agarwal, we each built two unique trusses using the Bridge Designer 2016 Software, which allowed us to customize the
				material type, member lengths, cross-sectional area of members, and joint locations. Through the iterative design process, we tweaked the
				cross sectional areas and material types of the members to create the most cost effective bridge. From the four bridges constructed, we
				systematically evaluated each one based on stability, cost, and simplicity to choose the best overall bridge to choose as our final design
				solution. Details on the Decision Matrix and the four bridge designs were outlined in our project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFGohpPFWi-YfMCk-JperWGU544-J8VcwN9BzjI2QTs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>. The final design solution,
				depicted to the right, features all carbon steel, the cheapest material available, as well as a pier, which extends upwards from the
				middle of the waterway. This bridge demonstrates an ideal balance between stability and cost-effectiveness, as it is cheaper than $300,000
				and still maintains rigidity.

			<p>The objective of the Greenfoot Educational Game Project was to develop a game through the Greenfoot Java Development Environment which would have
				some sort of educational benefit to its users. After brainstorming, my group, consisting of Derek X., Joshua B., and I, decided to create a typing
				game which would teach novice programmers to type Java syntax quickly. JavaTyper is different from ordinary typing games since it challenges it users
				to write Java code quickly with an exciting game dynamic. Depending on the level and typing speed of the programmer, the typing keywords can be customized
				and the game features flashy animations such as lasers shooting asteroids. I was mainly responsible for creating the asteroid falling mechanisms and the
				user input validation process. More details of the design process can be found in our project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15yUZfqKQSq5AwgbjDHIVqJgVo98nOkEni4DyAb3V4PM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

			<p>The objective of the Android Studio App Project was to develop a prototype of a mobile application which would be useful in solving an
				everyday problem. Initially, our group, consisting of Derek X., Joshua B, and I, brainstormed a list of common problems that can be solved. We ultimately
				decided to create an app which would quickly do mathematical analysis on simple shapes. This app, named "No More Geometry" strives to provide
				struggling geometry students with support and help them perform simple calculations with ease and quickness. Through the iterative design process,
				we received feedback from other student groups to refine our concept and get new, creative ideas. In the end, the app featured a simple user interface
				which allowed users to input a single quantity of the given shape (perimeter, area, side length, radius, etc.) and the app would calculate the rest.
